    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Â½ tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>1 onion, peeled and finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 x 500g pack British Beef Steak Mince 15% fat</li>
        <li>1 tsp mixed dried herbs</li>
        <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
        <li>4 slices mature Cheddar (optional)</li>
        <li>4 white rolls</li>
        <li>few round lettuce leaves, torn</li>
        <li>1 beef tomato, sliced</li>
        <li>ketchup, to serve (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>First step</li>
        <p>Heat the olive oil in a frying pan, add the onion and cook for 5 minutes
            until softened and starting to turn golden. Set aside.</p>
        <li>Second step</li>
        <p>In a bowl, combine the beef mince with the herbs and the egg. 
            Season, add the onions and mix well. Using your hands, shape into 
            4 patties.</p>
        <li>Third step</li>
        <p>Cook the burgers on a preheated barbecue or griddle for 5-6 minutes 
            on each side. While the second side is cooking, lay a slice of cheese 
            on top to melt slightly (if using).</p>
        <li>Forth step</li>
        <p>Meanwhile, lightly toast the cut-sides of the buns on the barbecue. 
            Fill with the lettuce, burgers and tomato slices. Serve with ketchup, 
            if you like.</p>
    </ol>
